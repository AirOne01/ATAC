## Description

ATAC is **A**rguably a **T**erminal **A**PI **C**lient. It is based on well known clients such as Postman, Insomnia or even Bruno, but inside your terminal without any specific graphical environment needed.

The philosophy of ATAC is to be free, account-less and offline for now and forever.
